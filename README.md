# myProject

This website can be viewed at www.alltruefarm.com

This is my final project for WebLab 2016 and is my first attempt at a website. It is a work in progress and still has quite a few bugs and pages that I would like to change.

Items that need to be fixed:

Adding css media queries so it is legible on mobile devices.

Flip images on one of the pages.

Fix reset and errors on contact page.

Keyboard hides input boxes on contact page.
